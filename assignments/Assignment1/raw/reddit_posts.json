I asked him why he bothered if he was never going to see his boss or clients. He told me it helped him remain professional and keep a solid work/life boundary.\n\nFast forward to today where I work from my spare bedroom/home office. It's rare that I'm in anything more than shorts or sweats. Some days I have shoes on, but most days I don't. If I have to take a Zoom call, I comb my hair and put on a nice shirt, but everything below the desk is still casual. Some days I never even leave the sofa and do everything from my laptop.\n\nI'm just curious to know where other people fall.

        "text": "This is going to be a fun read, I promise. \ud83c\udf7f\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what I call the \u201ctelenovela principle\u201d. I\u2019m not a cognitive scientist, and these ideas come purely from observation and experience. But if you\u2019ve ever been caught up in a telenovela or a long-running series, you\u2019ll know the feeling: the intricate power plays, the unspoken hierarchies, the rituals of dominance, and the subtle tensions that keep the drama alive. Even if you step away for a while, the moment you return, you\u2019re right back in it, and you are *part* of it, immediately recalling the dynamics, decoding glances, and anticipating the next twist.\n\nThe office works the same way. When you\u2019re in person, even part-time, you\u2019re a participant in this ongoing story. There\u2019s always a \u201cbig monkey\u201d asserting dominance, the boss who commands unspoken rituals of loyalty, like requiring everyone to laugh at their jokes or adjust their tone in their presence. There are the everyday performers, like the colleague who thrives on adoration or the gatekeeper who silently enforces invisible rules. These aren\u2019t written in any handbook, but they exist, and they require your mental energy to navigate. You find yourself noticing the power struggles, the alliances forming in hushed conversations, and the subtle gestures signaling favor or disapproval. It\u2019s an endless stream of social processing, often unrelated to the actual work.\n\nHybrid work doesn\u2019t escape this dynamic. Each time you enter the office, it\u2019s like pressing play on a paused series. You have to catch up on the latest storylines: who\u2019s climbing the ladder, who\u2019s fallen out of favor, what new rituals or hierarchies have taken shape. The telenovela is still there, waiting for you, demanding the same mental energy to re-engage with the social mechanics. Hybrid work doesn\u2019t simplify the drama at all; it just makes it episodic, reinforcing the need to tune back into the plot every time you return.\n\nFully remote work eliminates this layer of complexity. The drama loses its stage when everyone is behind a screen. Without the proximity to assert dominance or build unspoken hierarchies, the focus shifts to what truly matters: the work itself. While remote collaboration still involves interaction, it\u2019s more task-oriented and far less emotionally draining. It spares you from the subtle politics, the rituals of adoration, and the constant recalibration that in-person work demands. The absence of this unnecessary \u201cstory\u201d frees up your mental space, allowing you to focus on your creativity, productivity, and actual goals. It\u2019s no wonder that some \u201cbig personalities\u201d resist remote work: it removes the tools they depend on to thrive in this unspoken telenovela. \nRemote work frees us to skip the BS, so to let the big personalities cling to their shenanigans, leaving the drama to the TV.",

Many leaders seem more comfortable seeing people at desks than measuring actual output.\n\nBut here's what puzzles me: If remote work enables:\n\n* Access to global talent\n* Higher employee satisfaction\n* Lower operational costs\n* Better work-life balance\n* Equal or better productivity\n\nWhy are companies so eager to give these benefits up?\n\n# Looking for Perspectives\n\nFor those in companies pushing return-to-office:\n\n* What's the actual reasoning given?\n* Have productivity metrics actually improved after returning?\n* How has it affected employee retention?\n\nFor remote workers:\n\n* What tools/practices make remote work successful for you?\n* How do you maintain work-life balance?\n* What challenges have you faced and how did you overcome them?",

Some of these jobs are 2 hours away each way. The last time I had a job like that I was only able to see my family for 1-2 hours a day before they went to bed. Driving would get me those 1-2 hours and was really damn expensive and taking public transportation was reimbursed but would get me home between 11pm-12am and then I\u2019d gotta get up and out the door before 8am. Felt like I never saw anyone except my coworkers.",

        "title": "Walmart Demands Remote Workers Relocate for 'In-Person Culture', Then Asks Arkansas Employees to Work Remotely After Tornadoes Hit",
        "text": "Last month, Walmart announced layoffs and the closure of 51 Health Clinics across the United States. Employees in the Health & Wellness division, initially reassured of their job security, faced another blow just two weeks later:\n\nA majority of Walmart's full-time remote employees received notice this month to relocate to Arkansas or accept severance (if eligible). Concurrently, several hundred other corporate workers across North America received layoff notices without the option to relocate. A smaller number of employees were given the choice to move to remaining offices in the San Francisco Bay, New York, and New Jersey areas. Notably, these offers are based on role and business needs rather than employee proximity to existing offices, resulting in some workers being asked to relocate across the country despite living near a Walmart office. Additionally, if two workers living in the same household receive relocation notices to different offices, the location for the more \"senior\" role will take precedence.\n\nThe reason provided for the latest changes? \"Walmart is an in-person culture,\" and they want workers reporting to the office five days a week...(**edit: primarily in Northwest Arkansas**).\n\nThis decision came despite the significant contributions of remote workers who helped the company navigate the pandemic, forge new ways of working, and achieve record profits. Walmart's latest financial report, released just days after the second round of layoff and relocation notices, showed profits of over $5 billion.\n\nIronically, after sending the in-person work mandate, a series of deadly tornadoes struck northwest Arkansas this Memorial Day weekend, causing widespread damage and power outages that affected Walmart's Home Office and many employees in the surrounding areas. In response, Walmart asked its Arkansas employees to work remotely for now...\n\n**---**  \n**Edit**: I apologize if my initial post is too nuanced. I appreciate all the perspectives shared here.\n\nThe irony I see here is multifaceted. The overall timing of events:\n\n* underscores the need to **support adaptability in working styles**, not criticize and deprioritize them\n* sadly exposes the reality of natural disasters overlooked by the fantasy life/culture narrative the company is pushing on workers **(most recently, to a mass workforce across the continent just two weeks ago)**\n* shows the hypocrisy of the company's previous **praise of remote work during emergencies**, their **abrupt shift to devalue it**, and their subsequent need to **rely on it again after an emergency**\n* emphasizes an \"**in-person culture**\" while a significant portion of their revenue and growth comes from **online sales** that is supported by remote networks\n* **promotes digital transformation** to its millions of customers (who also make up their workforce), **but resists it internally**\n\nI feel deeply for those affected by all of these events. Losing your home or loved ones, losing your livelihood, facing relocation demands that prioritize the company after having already uprooted/adapted your life and families to support the company's previous remote work demands...it's all devastating.\n\nIn addition, the NW Arkansas employees being expected to navigate difficult conditions after the storms, scrambling to find friends or businesses with working internet and power so they can report to the office remotely is a whole separate concern but still very relevant.\n\n**\"Prioritize your work commitments above your individual needs\"** seems like the real \"**in-person culture**\" they're pushing here.",

        "title": "The most powerful life hacks I've discovered for Remote work",
        "text": "I\u2019ve started working remotely with COVID and it's now a lifestyle many of us have embraced forever. But with the freedom of a home office comes unique challenges\u2014staying productive, maintaining work-life balance, and navigating the nuances of virtual communication, just to name a few. Here are some life hacks I found very valuable for myself to find a good balance working remotely.\n\n**Get Outside**\n\nJust 15 minutes out in the sun can help set your circadian rhythm, fire up your metabolism, and get your brain into high gear.\n\n**2-3 hours work out of your home-set up to enter flow**\n\nContrary to popular belief, remote work doesn't confine you to your home. I've found that a change of scenery can do wonders for entering a state of flow. I start the workday at home, and when I notice a dip in productivity, I relocate to a nearby caf\u00e9 for a focused 2-3 hour work session. This shift not only rejuvenates my creative juices but also acts as a mental 'reset,' helping me tackle tasks with renewed vigor.\n\n**Meditate, even if it is 10 mins.**\n\nIf we can't chill alone for 10 mins without checking our phones, we've got a big problem. Meditation is like the mental gym. You're training your brain to slow down, focus, and just *be.* I swear, it's like rebooting your brain.\n\nIf you start by your own you\u2019ll be overwhelmed; look on Youtube for \u201cguided meditation\u201d (you can find 5, 10, 15 and more videos depending on how you want to start). Also **Headpace** or **calm** have beginner guides usually for free.\n\n**Say Thanks, Feel Better**\n\nI've started jotting down five things I'm grateful for every day. Sounds simple, but does it change the game. When you focus on what you're thankful for, it's like you're hardwiring your brain to be happier. I'm talking better mood, stronger friendships, and even better health.\n\n**Write it Out**\n\nVery similar to the previous one, I've found that jotting down my thoughts every day is crazy beneficial. It's like I'm decluttering my brain. Plus, my communication skills have gone up a notch. You're going to need that, especially if you're aiming for success in today's world. There are also tons of apps for making journaling more enjoyable, like **Dayone, Diarium, Penzu**... Many of them are free.\n\n**Get a Wise Council**\n\nThe most successful people have mentors or a coach. Imagine getting life advice from someone who's already walked the path you're on. It's like life-hacking with cheat codes. The impact of this can't be overstated. So, seek out someone who's a few steps ahead of you in the game and absorb their wisdom like a sponge. Now with AI there are also some AI coaches that are a great way to start, because coaching is all about asking yourself the right question. **Wave coaching** is a good one.\n\n**Self-Care Isn't Selfish**\n\nWe're so busy grinding away for someone else that we forget to invest in the most important project: ourselves. Take 30 minutes daily to read, work out, or learn something new. Think of it as a non-negotiable meeting with yourself.\n\n**Read, really read**\n\nYou'd be surprised how few people actually read regularly. Set aside some time to dive into a book\u2014any book\u2014that piques your interest. It's like compound interest for your brain.\n\n**Cold shower in the morning**\n\nThis might sound nuts, but taking a 3-minute cold shower gives you this weird boost for the whole day. It\u2019s like you're shocking your body into beast mode. Seriously, try it.\n\n**Bed time alarm**\n\nDon't underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. Set an alarm to remind you to start winding down. Ditch the tech, maybe read something light, and just chill. You're setting the stage for a killer day ahead.\n\nLet me know if you have any other habits I should add to the post",

        "text": "Hey everyone, I\u2019ve been thinking about how much remote work can impact climate change, and it feels like it should be a bigger part of the conversation among climate activists.\n\nAs we all know Remote work can significantly reduce daily commutes, which means fewer cars on the road and less emissions. Studies have shown that working from home can lower carbon footprints by reducing energy use in office buildings and transportation. Yet, I rarely see this pushed as a major climate strategy??\n\nConsidering how much attention is placed on cutting emissions in other areas (like transportation and energy production), it\u2019s surprising that remote work isn\u2019t being highlighted more. In my opinon climate activist should be on the front line championing remote work and fighting against large corporations and their unnecessary RTO mandates which contribute to the destruction of our planet.\n\nThoughts? Why aren\u2019t we seeing more organized efforts promoting remote work as part of climate action? This is definitly a cause I see a lot of people supporting. Would love to hear your opinions!\n\n",

Usually the days I have to go in are fun and exciting with a variety of non desk based tasks and interactions with some really great colleagues.

It was always my biggest weakness as an employee and now I am doing just fine. \n\n\nThe only downside is, I don't think I can ever go back!

My husband had been working remotely and his work is now requiring 5 days a week in office with no option for hybrid. \n\nI have no idea how this is going to work out. His job is pretty speciality and it isn't common to find remote positions, he was just super lucky to find this one. He has looked at getting another job closer to home, but the compensation in our new area isn't as high. He now has to eat the commute or take a 25% pay cut, which isn't great considering that we just bought a house. \n\nWe are also paying for child care and I am a nurse working 13 hour shifts, so him having a remote job is a huge help given that there is zero child care that works with my schedule. Him being home for 2 hours at the beginning and end of each day make it possible for us to have child care. With him commuting, this will make it so that he is pretty much working 12 hour days too. This is honestly just a disaster for us. \n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation, what did you do?",

Ever since the layoff I have applied daily to any job that will hire me. All that seems to be open in my area is sales (I am not a salesperson and as a single mom, I can't rely on commission), tax preparers (No experience), and jobs that wouldn't sustain my basic living expenses. I'm 6 weeks away from finishing my Associates in Business before moving along to my Bachelor's. However, everything I see for my degree field either requires a Bachelor's degree or requires experience, which I obviously do not have. I struggle to understand how I can get experience if all the jobs require it. As I stated previously, I'm a single mom to a young child with no support so she is also no longer in daycare since I can't afford it. I know its frowned upon to work from home with a kid, but at this point its my only option until I get some money flowing again to get her back into daycare. My savings is running low and I have maybe a good month left, so immediate hire recommendations are preferred. I appreciate any and all advice on this!",

Less traffic equals fewer accidents and a smoother ride for everyone.\n- Hunting for Parking Sucks: With less people driving to work, finding a parking spot won\u2019t feel like the Hunger Games.\n- Delays Be Gone: buses on time more often thanks to less traffic \n- Breath of Fresh Air: With fewer cars on the road, we\u2019re not just cutting down on noise pollution but also slashing the amount of noxious gases choking up our air. This means a significant bump in air quality, making those deep, city breaths a lot less toxic.\n- Healthier, Happier Cities: Embracing remote work could mean not just cleaner air but also fewer sick days for all. With less crowding on public transport and in offices, we're giving contagious diseases fewer chances to spread. Remember COVID?\n- Local Love, Global Work: By rooting for remote work, we're supporting an economy where spending isn't confined to city centers. It's a shift that promises to rejuvenate neighborhood businesses, as remote workers distribute their dollars closer to home, breathing new life into local markets.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nIf you can\u2019t work from home, you should still be all for remote work. Less hassle getting to work, and quicker rides. Plus, driving without playing dodge-the-idiot? Priceless. Remote work\u2019s making everyone\u2019s day a bit easier, even if your office is still your second home.",

I've even been accused of having a \"Napolean Complex\".  What they really mean is \"why don't you act your height\". I recognize that it's discrimination, but height discrimination isn't popular to talk about because it's so common. Check any dating app and you'll see \"sorry. no guys under 6 feet\"\n\nThis hasn't happened since remote work started. Nobody sees your height anymore over teams. It was such a refreshing change.\n\nHeight is my issue but I'm sure there's 1000's of others who share the same view for different forms of discrimination. I'm sure many women feel less harassed due to remote work for example.\n\nPlease, if your company is making people return to floor.

Before that I worked in service where there was terrible pay but hustle and bustle.\n\nNow I make more than I ever have but I find everyday feels like I'm wasting away. My tasks are open ended , with deadlines I set. There never is any consequence to me doing something at 2pm or me doing something at 2 am. I go from screen to screen , laptop ,phone, tv and it's disheartening. \n\nI really struggle with the discipline needed for work and for personal growth. I've read atomic habits and tried to implement small wins but 1 win to a 16 hour day is still out of balance. I've tried to do co-working spaces but my job has a lot of meetings so I end up locked up in one of those phone booths which doesn't feel much better.\n\nI live alone and I don't have kids but I do have 1 cat. I really have no reason to interact with the outside world except to get groceries or do laundry. Every day feels like one long day and even when I break it up with a walk, or a hang with a friend , a gym class , it's like I have to be a helicopter parent and schedule my every hour to make it work cause I fall off so fast and that in itself is exhausting.\n\nThese feelings really scare me cause it makes me feel like I might need a new job , something hybrid but that feels like it could be an overreaction. Sometimes I feel like i should be able to just start a new habit or hobby and build up a side hustle but then I get intimidated by the prospect of doing that well too. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this too? How did you cope? Did something help you break the cycle?\n\nThank you in advanced. ",

During the hybrid phase, a couple of my coworkers moved out of state and were allowed to stay remote permanently and we also hired a few fully remote people during this time as well.\n\nFast forward to this year. I have been considering moving out of state since I had a death in the family and wanted to be closer to them, and its the same state as the other remote workers so I thought it would be fine. But we got a new CEO and he decided that he's going to clamp down on remote work. The remote folks have not been fired but they are barred from raises or promotions as long as they are remote And hr will not answer any questions about remote work and have been dodging my requests to set up a meeting. We are still hybrid for the time being but who knows how long that will last.

I could often start work earlier than scheduled, and then take off early, but not always - if I had a meeting scheduled at the end of my normal shift, I was stuck. If I was working on a proposal of some sort, I could do quite a bit in my head while folding laundry or doing the dishes.  The pay was good, but the stress on my mental and physical health was bigger, and that\u2019s why I eventually quit. \n\nCurrently in a specialist / customer service roll. Shifts are set and I can\u2019t start early. Even breaks and lunch are scheduled at specific times. Clocking in late (5 minutes is late) leads to occurrence points which add up to termination. Leaving early accrues the same occurrence points. The metrics you have to meet can be very stressful. You can\u2019t always get the days off that you want approved. \n\nObviously not all remote jobs will fail the bullet points.

Sales people, especially early in their career, I think can MASSIVELY benefit from being in a room with superiors, where they can learn and absorb knowledge - I think there are a lot of sales folk missing out on this knowledge, experience and perspective \n\nThis doesn't just have to be sales people, we do software development, and I can see a lot of the guys who have only ever been remote, they don't interview as well, they don't deal with criticism, feedback, building rapport etc - the office really had something to say and add for culture and experience\n\n2. Focus - most people, just don't have the discipline, focus and determination for remote, quite a few colleagues in covid, dropped performance and never got it back - life took priority over work - I'm not saying this is a bad thing or good, I'm just saying, in a performance orientated operating model, this does not do the employee or employer any good \n\n3. Environment - we hire from South Africa a lot, and I've had to repeatedly deal with multiple hours, up to 8 hours per day, of \"load shedding\" where they have no electricity - or new parents with a small apartment, where they just don't have the space to work, freedom from distracting husbands, wives, kids\n\n4. The wrong career - a lot of people work to live, and with remote, you have such liberty to suck at your job, that if its not something you enjoy, or like or are interested in, your performance drops so much - and if you're not willing to do a job you like, or start liking the job you do have - I think you risk dismissal, poor performance, and less employment or progressive career opportunities \n\n  \nAnyway, its food for thought - you can look at the above and complain and disagree, or you can look at it as an opportunity - to find work you enjoy, take remote work more seriously, go into the office with zeal and enthusiasm, then later move to remote, start a company where you can be remote, find ways to improve focus etc \n\nReturn to office can suck, but I think for a lot of people, they needed it, and can greatly benefit from it :) \n\nNo idea how this subreddit is going to take this, but i'd love a good discussion on for and against RTO or Remote \n\n",

        "text": "I work in HR and wanted to share some thoughts on remote work, RTO policies, and what the future might hold.\n\nFirst off, I know HR often gets blamed for enforcing RTO, but trust me, we don\u2019t want to go back to the office either. The push comes from senior leadership, and unfortunately, it\u2019s our job to implement it. But we dislike it just as much as everyone else, if not more, because we see firsthand how problematic it can be.\n\nDuring the pandemic, when everyone was working from home, leadership frequently reminded us that we\u2019d return to the office once it was safe. However, as the job market shifted in favor of employees, many people started quitting, citing the desire to remain remote during exit interviews. This wasn\u2019t a small number. Entire teams were dismantled, and filling roles took forever because candidates were clear that remote work was non-negotiable. To combat this attrition and attract talent faster, leadership had no choice but to adjust their stance and embrace remote work as a permanent option.\n\nBut by 2024, as the job market turned back in favor of employers, they flipped the script again and announced RTO.\n\nI believe these companies are setting themselves up for a rude awakening when the job market shifts back toward employees. The mass exodus they experienced before, and their struggle to fill positions due to a lack of flexible work options, will leave them with no choice but to adjust their stance again.\n\nIn the long run, I don\u2019t see RTO lasting. Employees have experienced the benefits of remote work, and once the job market shifts again, I expect smart companies will leverage remote work to attract top talent. Meanwhile, those that stick with rigid RTO policies may find themselves falling behind.",

        "text": "Hey everyone, I work a hybrid job where I'm remote for three weeks a month and in the office for one week. There\u2019s no difference in the duties performed between home and office. It's the exact same work.\n\nRecently, though, my company announced that remote work privileges could be revoked for employees who arrive late or leave early on in-office days. Productivity has never been an issue, as early mornings/late afternoons are typically unsupervised times to knock out individual tasks. Here\u2019s the kicker: we\u2019ve never been clocked. Even on in-office days, there\u2019s no formal clock-in or clock-out process. But now, HR is allegedly monitoring our FIB key scans (the cards we use to access the building) to track when we enter and leave.\n\nIt came as a surprise to all of us this week. For example, my shift ends at 4 PM, and sometimes I\u2019d get to my car a few minutes early so I could drive off right as the clock stricks 4. But now, I have to be extra careful to swipe their FIB keys exactly at 4 to avoid any potential \"ding\" from HR. What about if someone is in front of me and swipes but holds the door open for me? I can't take any chances, and now need to make sure I still swipe out, even if the door is open.  There's no company policy in writing stating every employee must swipe in and out individually when entering and exiting the building. This just came out of left field after we have had such a casual in-office atmosphere for the past five years I've been with the company.\n\nBut now, all of a sudden, middle managers are claiming HR is reviewing FIB key timestamps and calling people out individually for discrepancies. It\u2019s created a weird atmosphere of paranoia and micromanagement.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this\n\nDoes this undermine the flexibility remote work is supposed to offer?\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating because this feels like a complete 180 from how things were handled before, and it\u2019s making the one-week in-office way more stressful than it needs to be. Now all of a sudden, we are told, if caught arriving late or leaving early, it will be a first-time warning, and the second time, removal of remote privileges, and the person in violation must return to the office full-time. I never knew WFH was a \"privilege\" instead of part of the company's work rotation.",

        "text": "I don't buy that 5 day RTO will improve collaboration or any performance metrics. In fact I expect productivity to get worse. Here's why:\n\n*Increased commute*\n\nThis one is probably the most obvious, but with thr average commute times being around 30 mins, that's an extra hour of your day gone. It's hard to give your best when you're 1) tired from commuting 2) feeling worn down because you have less time in the day to attend to personal life\n\nThat's not even considering the extra fuel needed to commute more, putting more financial pressure on employees in an already difficult economy\n\n*Familiarity breeds contempt*\n\nI've worked fully remote, fully in office and hybrid. In my opinion, hybrid is the sweet spot where you continue to manage social relationships with your coworkers which is very useful for productivity. However, seeing/having lunch with your coworkers after a few days a week gets old and annoying. More time spent together also means more chances to get tired of the little annoying things they might do. Like a dripping faucet. Hybrid allowed a nice reset so I felt ready for interaction again\n\n*More hassle*\n\nPrompting everyone to return means more struggle to find parking, more traffic, more accidents (I've seen an unreal amount of them the past couple weeks). \n\nMeal prepping for the entire week lest you have to eat out and spend unnecessary money. I know this is what they want, but it's frustrating nonetheless\n\n\n*Less privacy/deep thought*\n\nIn office is okay when trying to purely execute on a task from muscle memory but for those who require quiet for deep concentration, it's not the place, especially for an open floorplan office. \n\nAdditionally, coworkers will sometimes interrupt when you're in a flow state which really hurts overall productivity\n\nWhen I worked fully remotely, I ended up getting promoted off of working 5-6 hour days because I was so much more productive working at home alone. \n\n*Additional factors*\n\nMore likely to get sick. It's winter and everyone is sick. They advise to stay home when sick but I honestly think it'd a badge of honor/dedication in the US to show up even when sick...I don't get it\n\n*Worse for the environment*\n\nIt's the in thing for companies to claim they're sustainable or going green these days, but unecessarily forcing people to commute in more often completely opposes that. \n\n*Meetings are a huge waste of time*\n\nThere is this culture of forced delinquency in meetings where you may or may not be needed, but you may sit in a 90 min meeting and only spent 5 mins talking. That time could be used for mindless tasks like packing the dishwasher or folding clothes while still listening and contributing when necessary \n\nAll in all, 5 day RTO seems completely unnecessary for people who can do their jobs remotely and it's infuriating to be micromanaged like this as an adult. As long as my semi annual reviews are good, who cares how often I'm in the office?\n",

        "title": "Why Remote Work is healthy - Read this . ",
        "text": "Read this post; I wrote it to help gather data from various articles (2023-24). If you\u2019re considering remote work or are already working from home, you might be curious about its benefits for your health and well-being. I've been working remotely for the past five years, even before COVID, when many people weren\u2019t familiar with the term 'remote work.' Today, I thought I should share some practical reasons why remote work is healthy and why everyone should try it at least once in their life.\n\nReasons:\n\n1. **Flexibility and Work-Life Balance** Remote work allows you to set your schedule, which can lead to a healthier work-life balance. A study from[ FlexJobs ](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/benefits-of-remote-work/)found that 73% of people say flexible work arrangements reduce stress. When you can choose when to work, it\u2019s easier to fit in breaks, exercise, and even spend time with family!\n2. **Reduced Commute Stress** Commuting can be a major source of stress and fatigue. Like We've all experienced how painful it can be to travel on crowded metros, wait for long hours for auto cabs, and constantly stress about reaching the office on time. According to a study by the [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/monitor/sep06/commutes), longer commutes are linked to higher stress levels. by working remotely, you can save that time (and energy) for things you love\u2014like hobbies or just relaxing! Seriously this is the one of the important point for me to work remotely.\n3. **Better Mental Health** Remote work can lead to improved mental health. A survey by[ Owl Labs ](https://empmonitor.com/blog/status-of-remote-work-in-2023/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20study%20by,transportation%2C%20meals%2C%20and%20clothing)revealed that remote workers report higher job satisfaction (about 82%!) and lower levels of burnout. Being able to create your own workspace (my art wall, with plants and books) and environment can help you feel more comfortable and focused.\n4. **Healthier Lifestyle Choices** When you work from home, it\u2019s easier to prioritise your health. You can cook healthier meals, take regular breaks to stretch or walk, and even set up a workspace that suits your needs. You are not only bound to take 15 mins tea break or 45 mins lunch break.  According to the [Global Workplace Analytics](https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics), remote workers tend to exercise more regularly, leading to better physical health.\n5. **Increased Productivity** Many remote workers find they\u2019re more productive at home. A study from [Stanford](https://www.apollotechnical.com/working-from-home-productivity-statistics/#:~:text=A%20study%20by%20Standford%20of,fewer%20breaks%20and%20sick%20days) found that remote workers are 13% more productive than their in-office counterparts. With fewer distractions from coworkers and the ability to create your ideal work environment, you might find it easier to focus and get things done.\n6. **Stronger Relationships** It may seem counterintuitive, but remote work can strengthen relationships. The same Owl Labs survey found that remote workers often feel more connected to their teams due to regular check-ins and virtual hangouts. Plus, you can spend more time with loved ones outside of work!\n\nIn conclusion, remote work isn\u2019t just a trend; it\u2019s a way to support your health and happiness and FREEDOM. If you\u2019re thinking about making the switch, consider these benefits and how they align with your lifestyle. Remember,, finding what works best for you is key to a happy, healthy work life!\n\nhave you also experienced any of these benefits? let's share your thoughts also!",

I think this one might be more obvious but I guess I'm wondering if it's about targeting a Mexican or Canadian company or if it's just about being outside of US borders providing goods and services to US clients and customers?\n\nI'm concerned that we won't be able to get remote jobs anymore and/or work abroad.\n\nI hope this makes sense. Any advice or article links or other resources for me to read would be very helpful. \n\nThank you!",

I studied math at university for a year but had to drop out due to a medical condition (I became paralyzed for a few months after an accident).

I\u2019ve been trying to land remote jobs, but with my limited credentials, I\u2019ve hit a wall. I\u2019m open to: Entry-level, technical roles with training or learning opportunities. Volunteering or unpaid work initially, to prove my abilities and build experience. Any suggestions about where to look for jobs or communities that are welcoming to beginners without degrees. If you know of companies, organizations, communities, resources, or where to look/people I could talk to that could help, or if you have advice, I\u2019d be incredibly grateful.

I know times are hard so here\u2019s my biggest advice to anyone wanting to work remote or need help finding one Quickly! \n\n#1. STOP using indeed. \n\u2022Don\u2019t ditch it completely, but put it on hold for right now. The goal is to get an immediate response\u2026 sites like indeed will SLOW YOU DOWN! \n\n#2. Stop applying to W-4 jobs and major companies. \n\u2022 There is nothing wrong with W-4 jobs but remember there are 1099 jobs instead. No corporate, No micro managing, No working extra hours for extra coins. Re adjust your options and stop finding W-4 jobs. \n\n#3. Look for 1099 companies instead! \n\u2022 1099 is being your own boss. DON\u2019T get discouraged or intimidated. It\u2019s the same as W-4.. you are on a regular pay roll (pay is better), you can create your own hours and not dealing with corporate. \n\n#4. Ditch your resume (YEP I SAID IT) \n\u2022 independent contractors remote jobs will NEVER ask you for a resume. Instead they ask for a clear background check and to be over 18. It\u2019s a simple sign up process and it takes 24-48 hours of approval. \n\u2022 They do require an assessment but it\u2019s EASY! It\u2019s an assessment about you & how you like to work. You don\u2019t need to have someone take it for you. If my old 18 year old self can do it SO CAN YOU! \n\n#5. DO NOT sign up for anyone \u201cvirtual call center\u201d\n\u2022 This is a deep topic itself but I\u2019m going to keep it short and sweet\u2026 it\u2019s real but you won\u2019t get far nor will you make as much money you would in a REGULAR 9-5. Stay away from them. It\u2019s temporary success and ends in failure. \n\nIf you have any questions let me know, I tried to keep it short and simple. I do have tons of 1099 remote jobs if anyone wants the resources, just from my own experience with working with them. I will NEVER talk poorly with 1099 work. It\u2019s a game changer, I travel full time now. ",

        "text": "I'm currently looking for a job and see a lot of companies that specify that they are open for remote work, but only within their base country. I think this was relatively common for U.S. companies even pre-pandemic (and definitely now, too), although a good proportion of U.S. companies, as long as they permit remote, don't care about the country of residence, and simply specify \"remote (US East timezones)\" or something like this.\n\nWhereas in Europe, I noticed that phrases like \"remote within Germany\", \"remote within UK\", or even \"remote within A, B, C\", where A, B, and C are several \\*specific\\* European countries became very common. I didn't notice that at all a few years ago. And it appears rather rare that a European company specifies in job descriptions \"remote within EU\" or \"remote as long as you can work CET business hours\", at least ostensibly.\n\nWhy is this fixation of European companies on their remote employees to be based in their base country? I understand that they are probably afraid to complicate their legal and tax work, but aren't RemoteOps companies like [https://remote.com/](https://remote.com/) supposed to alleviate the companies from all these burdens?",

        "text": "I left my remote job earlier this year because I was pretty burnt out. The money was decent and I had the potential to grow my salary, but at that point, the money was not worth my mental health (I was almost hospitalized from burnout). I got a new job that is 5 days in the office and took a $10K paycut (which I thought would end up not making a difference, but it really does smh). I bought a car and of course, with the car came expenses for gas every week and a half, required maintenance and the dreaded insurance. At my job, there is also heavy pressure to go to happy hour and drink heavily, as well as spend money to participate in activities for \"the office culture\".\n\nI realized immediately I made a huge mistake taking this in-office job. I know that I can start bringing lunches from home, say no to happy hours and activities, etc, but along with taking a paycut, I am losing so much money.\n\nI am debating finding a remote job again so that I can save money and hopefully get a higher salary. I also hate going into the office. Is this a good idea? I would still have the car and its expenses, but I could potentially sell it. I know I made a lot of dumb mistakes, but I want to fix my situation. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated! ",

        "text": "Hey y'all, I saw there was one post on this more than 2 years ago, but figure there is more people likely having to go through this situation with the RTO push in the last year or two. \n\nAnyways, I've been at my job for 5.5 years now, and have been fully remote since March 2020. In mid-2021, they tried to get everyone to come back, and almost everyone basically told them to go fuck themselves. As a result, they sold the office in our city, and now they don't make any US employee go in outside of those they hire for the NY office. \n\nThat said, I have noticed that all the roles they hire for nowadays are either hybrid or in-office roles, and while I don't worry this will affect me very soon (given I am more than 15 hours from the nearest current office), I am worried that they will stop hiring remote workers entirely and look to prioritize a RTO down the line, given I do live about 90 minutes away still from where the original office used to be. I know that our CEO does not like remote work, even if there are many higher ups that do, and so I worry eventually he'll win out. \n\nHonestly, the ability to work remote (and be able to travel/work outside the US on occasion) is the primary reason I am still at this job, as the pay is at least 10-20% less than I could get otherwise, the work has gotten to be less interesting, and my progression has stagnated as the company has gotten bigger. Given that, if they ever were to do a RTO, I am 99% sure I would look for other work.\n\nHowever, I am curious hypothetically: for those who've had RTOs and just flat out refused, what did happen to you? For me I'd look at it as likely a win-win: either they let me continue doing it while I find a place that actually prioritizes it, or they fire me and maybe I get unemployment/severance pay while I look for that other job. \n\nHowever, I assume it is likely not that simple, so I'm curious how it is from other people with experience!",

I will get reimbursed for the purchase! ",

        "text": "Rant incoming. \n\nI work for a large-ish financial firm and was remote from 2020 until this past November. My team was required to RTO 2-3 days per week which I really didn\u2019t have a problem with because I live so close to the office (5 minute drive).\n\nTwo of my teammates live in a different state and report into that office with my manager, three are fully remote because they don\u2019t live within commutable distance to any office, and two would be reporting into my office with me. My first day in office I found out those two local teammates requested accommodations to not come in so I have been by myself in the office since November. \n\nShortly after returning, my team (so me and our SVP) was moved to a different building where all the advisor facing teams sit. I\u2019m already a pretty shy person and all the people I sit around now are people I do not work with and have nothing to talk about with them. They\u2019re large teams of 20+ people who all know each other and I feel so alone. \u2639\ufe0f I know that\u2019s a me problem but still.\n\nAll my meetings are still on teams/webex, I talk to maybe one person when I\u2019m in the office, while my team is sitting at home bullshitting in the teams group chat. It just feels so pointless that I\u2019m going into the office just to sit by myself and still have my meetings virtually.",

        "text": "I have a group of friends who basically left the U.S. and moved abroad to countries like Spain or Portugal. Of course the cost of living there is drastically cheaper. Some of them work locally in those countries. They don't earn much but seem happy. But I was thinking maybe I can do the same however work a remote sales job instead where I can make a decent income and spend way less. I am thinking of securing a solid sales job remotely first and then make the move. Like, making 50-75k a year abroad while spending less than $1500/month seems a great way to save some money and also make a chance. I feel that I want to a fresh start somewhere and explore while also being able to save some money. \n\n  \nAny thoughts or advice... Thank you!",

        "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI got hired to this company when they contacted me via e-mail about my application in LinkedIn 2 days ago. They said it was for a video editing position. They said training will happen via Zoom. I didn't apply for it (or maybe I did because I noticed some companies from the job posting are like parent companies who are filling out said positions for their smaller companies).\n\nYesterday, they sent me an \" intuitive series of screening questions\" via PDF in which I happily answered and it has 18 questions. The PDF; however, after the initial set of questions, displayed a job duty that seems to be related to programming instead of the ones from a video editing position. I didn't bother with it though since people make mistakes. \n\nThey asked what rate I'm looking for, I said $30/hr.\n\nToday, I got hired and now went heartbroken because this feels like a scam. After applying and doing interviews to a hundred of video editing jobs for the past few months already, getting this one was just too easy. No video interviews or call interviews, just this email and a set of questions.\n\nIn the new PDF, they explained that I can start on the 20th. It includes the video editing duties, benefits, compensation, the termination of employment, vacation, and the confidential stuff. \n\nThey also offered $60/hr and $30/hr during the training session on Zoom.\n\nThey want me to write my full name, my residential address, signature, and date. On the email where this PDF came from, they said: \n\n\"It is imperative that you print this letter, carefully peruse its contents, affix your signature with a copy of your valid front and back identification, which you must attach to this document for job confirmation, and then reply to this email with your response.\"  \n  \nThey also mentioned about sending office equipment which I got curious about because I will be using my computer for video editing anyways.\n\nThere are two names in the email: the sender's name and the CEO. I found their LinkedIn and indeed they work on said company. The company even looked legit on LinkedIn too.\n\nTheir new PDF isn't AI written.\n\nAlso on the last email, they said that \"any unclaimed portions of this offer will be forfeited as of the end of business on\u00a0December\u00a013, 2024...\" so I really want to go through this application now.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",
