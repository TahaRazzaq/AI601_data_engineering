I'm going entirely insane trying to find a real place to find remote work,"I've been applying on indeed and LinkedIn for months with about 20-60 jobs applied for during a week. Only people who got back to me were a few scams and some accidental in person jobs I applied for. For personal health reasons I can only work remote. I can't seem to find ANYTHING better than what I do which is insane when I'm only making 14 an hour. So where can find literally anything better?

Edit: I've got 6 years experience with customer service and sales. I have light coding experience but nowhere near enough to do anything more than entry level for that. I graduated high school and didn't go to college I couldn't afford it.",Sammy_Wants_Death,2024-08-05,291,remotework

Do you get dressed for work when working remote?,"My dad was an early remote worker in the early 2000s...before he had high speed internet or even Zoom.

Every morning, he'd get up, shower, shave, put on a shirt and tie, and head to his office in the spare bedroom. I asked him why he bothered if he was never going to see his boss or clients. He told me it helped him remain professional and keep a solid work/life boundary.

Fast forward to today where I work from my spare bedroom/home office. It's rare that I'm in anything more than shorts or sweats. Some days I have shoes on, but most days I don't. If I have to take a Zoom call, I comb my hair and put on a nice shirt, but everything below the desk is still casual. Some days I never even leave the sofa and do everything from my laptop.

I'm just curious to know where other people fall. Do you ""get ready for work"" or just stumble through the house when it's time to get work done?

Hospitals in some areas are already becoming overloaded. Does anyone see a repeat of 2020 happening? Because I sure do. I have a hunch that in a few months employers are going to be forced to rethink their RTO mandates and allow people to WFH fully. That includes hardcore RTO proponents like Elon Musk and Jamie Dimon.

I've gained 24 pounds working remotely over the last 6 years,"I started working remotely in 2019. I love remote work. 

The only downside is that I went from bike commuting 3.5 miles each way, and navigating a large office - 25 yards to the bathroom, 50 yards to the break room, to effectively being in my house 24/7. 

I've effectively gained 0.5 lbs per month. 

I truly love remote work and wouldn‚Äôt trade it for all but the best job offers ‚Äî but sheesh it‚Äôs a bummer to gain weight.

"Your favorite, not obvious benefit of remote work","Typically, the same benefits of remote are cited over and over. No commute. Flexibility. Time with family, pets, etc.

But what's your favorite, never talked about benefits?

The real reason bosses hate remote work.,"After the remote work experiment, many bosses went nuts and shared videos about employees not working at all but playing video games and doing laundry.

The thing is, what actually happen is that remote work showed off the bad planning of the company.  
And most of that bad planning is actually a result of ""office politics"".  
So, by not being in an office, there is no ""politics"", hence, the only thing you can measure is output.  
But, as you can imagine, most of the time we used to spend in the office was playing ""office politics"" and spending time on stupid things to be perceived as ""hardworking"".   
And, once we went remote, employees realize they could finish their assignments is about half of the time.  
So, many went for a second or a third job, which didn¬¥t affect the performance of any, an the proof is most managers never suspect anything about it.   
In a nutshell, what is actually happening is the job market is shifting towards the gig economy and the uberization of gig works.  
And that implies most middle management is useless, as well as the giant real estate most companies own.  
This shit could break drown the whole thing, destroying the system because it would lead to mass white-collar layoffs.   
An that is the thing, corporate America is degrading, the system is being corrupted, so corrupted it is no longer the same anymore, it would be a new system: the sharing economy.",JuggernautBulky1008,2024-08-18,1704,remotework

The hidden cost of hybrid and in-person work: why fully remote is a game changer,"This is going to be a fun read, I promise. üçø

Let‚Äôs talk about what I call the ‚Äútelenovela principle‚Äù. I‚Äôm not a cognitive scientist, and these ideas come purely from observation and experience. But if you‚Äôve ever been caught up in a telenovela or a long-running series, you‚Äôll know the feeling: the intricate power plays, the unspoken hierarchies, the rituals of dominance, and the subtle tensions that keep the drama alive. Even if you step away for a while, the moment you return, you‚Äôre right back in it, and you are *part* of it, immediately recalling the dynamics, decoding glances, and anticipating the next twist.

The office works the same way. When you‚Äôre in person, even part-time, you‚Äôre a participant in this ongoing story. There‚Äôs always a ‚Äúbig monkey‚Äù asserting dominance, the boss who commands unspoken rituals of loyalty, like requiring everyone to laugh at their jokes or adjust their tone in their presence. There are the everyday performers, like the colleague who thrives on adoration or the gatekeeper who silently enforces invisible rules. These aren‚Äôt written in any handbook, but they exist, and they require your mental energy to navigate. You find yourself noticing the power struggles, the alliances forming in hushed conversations, and the subtle gestures signaling favor or disapproval. It‚Äôs an endless stream of social processing, often unrelated to the actual work.

Hybrid work doesn‚Äôt escape this dynamic. Each time you enter the office, it‚Äôs like pressing play on a paused series. You have to catch up on the latest storylines: who‚Äôs climbing the ladder, who‚Äôs fallen out of favor, what new rituals or hierarchies have taken shape. The telenovela is still there, waiting for you, demanding the same mental energy to re-engage with the social mechanics. Hybrid work doesn‚Äôt simplify the drama at all; it just makes it episodic, reinforcing the need to tune back into the plot every time you return.

Fully remote work eliminates this layer of complexity. The drama loses its stage when everyone is behind a screen. Without the proximity to assert dominance or build unspoken hierarchies, the focus shifts to what truly matters: the work itself. While remote collaboration still involves interaction, it‚Äôs more task-oriented and far less emotionally draining. It spares you from the subtle politics, the rituals of adoration, and the constant recalibration that in-person work demands. The absence of this unnecessary ‚Äústory‚Äù frees up your mental space, allowing you to focus on your creativity, productivity, and actual goals. It‚Äôs no wonder that some ‚Äúbig personalities‚Äù resist remote work: it removes the tools they depend on to thrive in this unspoken telenovela. 
Remote work frees us to skip the BS, so to let the big personalities cling to their shenanigans, leaving the drama to the TV.",RevolutionStill4284,2025-01-06,992,remotework

Why Are Companies Abandoning Successful Remote Work Models? A Perspective from a Fully Remote Team,"I've been watching with bewilderment as companies rush to end remote work policies that were working perfectly well. As someone leading a successful remote-first team, I wanted to share our experience and hear your thoughts.

# Our Remote Success Story

We've built a truly global team across San Francisco, Korea, and Japan, achieving something that would have been impossible with traditional office requirements. Here's what's working for us:

# Productivity & Work-Life Balance

* Team members with children can better balance family responsibilities
* No time wasted on commuting
* Flexible hours allow people to work when they're most productive
* Clear boundaries between work and personal life

# Tools & Infrastructure

* Proper remote work tools make collaboration seamless
* Virtual meetings are efficient and well-structured
* Async communication has improved our documentation
* Digital workflows have actually increased transparency

# Global Talent Advantage

* Access to exceptional talent regardless of location
* Diverse perspectives from different time zones
* Ability to serve customers 24/7 naturally
* Significant cost savings on office space

# Common Arguments Against Remote Work (And Why They Don't Hold Up)

# ""People are less productive at home""

In our experience, the opposite is true. With proper tools and processes, our team's productivity has increased. The key is measuring output, not hours at a desk.

# ""We lose company culture""

We've built a strong culture through:

* Regular virtual social events
* Organized in-person meetups
* Clear communication channels
* Strong onboarding processes

# ""Collaboration suffers""

We've found that:

* Written communication improves clarity
* Meetings are more focused
* Documentation is better
* Cross-timezone collaboration brings fresh perspectives

# The Real Question

I suspect the push back to offices isn't about productivity but about control. Many leaders seem more comfortable seeing people at desks than measuring actual output.

But here's what puzzles me: If remote work enables:

* Access to global talent
* Higher employee satisfaction
* Lower operational costs
* Better work-life balance
* Equal or better productivity

Why are companies so eager to give these benefits up?

# Looking for Perspectives

For those in companies pushing return-to-office:

* What's the actual reasoning given?
* Have productivity metrics actually improved after returning?
* How has it affected employee retention?

For remote workers:

* What tools/practices make remote work successful for you?
* How do you maintain work-life balance?
* What challenges have you faced and how did you overcome them?",Bright-Paint-5238,2024-11-05,524,remotework

Remote work for my job was pulled for me last week and now I have to be fully in office.,"So far I have
- Done less work in a week than I did in a day remotely.
- Bled all over myself and everything from four bloody noses in a single datyy horrifying my coworkers and manager 
- Had severe automotive issues occur so I'm going to have to take the rest of the week off for it to be repaired because I live too far to Uber cheaply.
- Not worked a second on one of the few projects that has a deadline for us as it was slated to be a remote only project to feign Ignorance when it blows all up. Had to audit 10 massive different spreadsheets and validate files for them and finished 3 working remotely one day. 
- Spent time getting my resume and cover letter back together to apply for a different position elsewhere. And had it reviewed.


Any other recommendations?

Shutting down the ‚Äòremote work was never supposed to last‚Äô argument,"The claim that ‚Äúremote work was never supposed to be a permanent concession‚Äù falls apart when you dig into how companies actually handled it. 

Plenty of them leaned hard into remote setups or brought on fully remote employees without ever spelling out that it was temporary, only to pull a fast one later by forcing everyone back.

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/culture-key-hybrid-work-michael-dell

Others kept things murky on purpose, dodging tough conversations until the economy tanked and employees couldn‚Äôt push back as easily. That kind of move screams opportunism to me, not leadership. 

On top of that, companies often play favorites, letting top execs and star employees sidestep the rules while the rest of the workforce is told to suck it up. 

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pays-work-remotely-only-youre-new-starbucks-ceo-ryan-serhant-rq1ce

They also brush aside clear evidence that remote work gets the job done, trotting out tired excuses about ‚Äúculture‚Äù while pushing policies that go against their own green goals by shoving people back into long commutes. Add in the fact that employees are stuck footing the bill for gas, transit, or whatever else comes with being back in the office, and it‚Äôs clear these mandates are not about teamwork but control and real estate.

The simple reason remote work will win,"Every human system we can think of is built on top of shared beliefs. Where those shared beliefs are deeply questioned by the majority, every system wobbles, shakes, finally dies out.

The office-centric economy is a system. In 2019, very few (including me) were questioning it. It was the way of life we dealt with since the beginning of our careers. Ergo, the system was solidly standing in place.

Then, the pandemic came, and people first started missing office life, to then start questioning office life, more and more.

Now, RTO mandates are being issued, but people aren‚Äôt generally buying in, except for a minority. They‚Äôre questioning the foundations of RTO itself, and a lot. They‚Äôre seeing its flaws. They‚Äôre loathing commutes and cubicles.

It won‚Äôt be apparent immediately, but any RTO initiative is destined to be an intrinsic failure, due to so many people calling BS on it.

It‚Äôs just a question of when, rather than if, offices will die out as the preferred way of conducting business for remote-capable jobs.

There‚Äôs no going back when minds deeply change. Systems need supporters, not detractors and questioners. There aren‚Äôt enough of the first. There are too few believers left.",RevolutionStill4284,2024-02-03,827,remotework
Disappearing remote work,"I am not usually a conspiracy type but I can't escape the feeling that there is some type of orchestration between public and private entities to put an end to (or significantly reduce) remote work as a rule/default employment. I know for example New York and Washington D.C. have openly pressured their private sector to ""bring back the workers"" (DC mandated RTO early this year). Despite the data showing that there is no loss in productivity with remote work, companies are still insisting on full RTO (Amazon and Dell as the latest example). It just does not seem logical to me unless there are other motives. ",ConsiderationNo8228,2024-10-10,347,remotework
Changing Address at work to remain remote,"I have worked remotely for over 10 years.

I sold my car, do not have childcare that would work with the commute hours/etc. We have scheduled our lives and our 4 childrens lives around my remote capability. It would cost me more to return to the office than my take home pay per year.

I have a family member with a home about 3 hours away (same state). I can easily change my work address in our system to their address and be outside of the 50 miles and remain remote. Are there any ramifications to this besides them potentially finding out and getting fired? (Which will happen anyway when I cannot return)",Aggressive_Yak_6021,2024-11-21,326,remotework

The last time I had a job like that I was only able to see my family for 1-2 hours a day before they went to bed. Driving would get me those 1-2 hours and was really damn expensive and taking public transportation was reimbursed but would get me home between 11pm-12am and then I‚Äôd gotta get up and out the door before 8am.

"Walmart Demands Remote Workers Relocate for 'In-Person Culture', Then Asks Arkansas Employees to Work Remotely After Tornadoes Hit","Last month, Walmart announced layoffs and the closure of 51 Health Clinics across the United States. Employees in the Health & Wellness division, initially reassured of their job security, faced another blow just two weeks later:

A majority of Walmart's full-time remote employees received notice this month to relocate to Arkansas or accept severance (if eligible). Concurrently, several hundred other corporate workers across North America received layoff notices without the option to relocate. A smaller number of employees were given the choice to move to remaining offices in the San Francisco Bay, New York, and New Jersey areas. Notably, these offers are based on role and business needs rather than employee proximity to existing offices, resulting in some workers being asked to relocate across the country despite living near a Walmart office. Additionally, if two workers living in the same household receive relocation notices to different offices, the location for the more ""senior"" role will take precedence.

The reason provided for the latest changes? ""Walmart is an in-person culture,"" and they want workers reporting to the office five days a week...(**edit: primarily in Northwest Arkansas**).

This decision came despite the significant contributions of remote workers who helped the company navigate the pandemic, forge new ways of working, and achieve record profits. Walmart's latest financial report, released just days after the second round of layoff and relocation notices, showed profits of over $5 billion.

Ironically, after sending the in-person work mandate, a series of deadly tornadoes struck northwest Arkansas this Memorial Day weekend, causing widespread damage and power outages that affected Walmart's Home Office and many employees in the surrounding areas. In response, Walmart asked its Arkansas employees to work remotely for now...

**---**  
**Edit**: I apologize if my initial post is too nuanced. I appreciate all the perspectives shared here.

The irony I see here is multifaceted. The overall timing of events:

* underscores the need to **support adaptability in working styles**, not criticize and deprioritize them
* sadly exposes the reality of natural disasters overlooked by the fantasy life/culture narrative the company is pushing on workers **(most recently, to a mass workforce across the continent just two weeks ago)**
* shows the hypocrisy of the company's previous **praise of remote work during emergencies**, their **abrupt shift to devalue it**, and their subsequent need to **rely on it again after an emergency**
* emphasizes an ""**in-person culture**"" while a significant portion of their revenue and growth comes from **online sales** that is supported by remote networks
* **promotes digital transformation** to its millions of customers (who also make up their workforce), **but resists it internally**

I feel deeply for those affected by all of these events. Losing your home or loved ones, losing your livelihood, facing relocation demands that prioritize the company after having already uprooted/adapted your life and families to support the company's previous remote work demands...it's all devastating.

In addition, the NW Arkansas employees being expected to navigate difficult conditions after the storms, scrambling to find friends or businesses with working internet and power so they can report to the office remotely is a whole separate concern but still very relevant.

**""Prioritize your work commitments above your individual needs""** seems like the real ""**in-person culture**"" they're pushing here.",circlebacklater,2024-05-29,833,remotework

The most powerful life hacks I've discovered for Remote work,"I‚Äôve started working remotely with COVID and it's now a lifestyle many of us have embraced forever. But with the freedom of a home office comes unique challenges‚Äîstaying productive, maintaining work-life balance, and navigating the nuances of virtual communication, just to name a few. Here are some life hacks I found very valuable for myself to find a good balance working remotely.

**Get Outside**

Just 15 minutes out in the sun can help set your circadian rhythm, fire up your metabolism, and get your brain into high gear.

**2-3 hours work out of your home-set up to enter flow**

Contrary to popular belief, remote work doesn't confine you to your home. I've found that a change of scenery can do wonders for entering a state of flow. I start the workday at home, and when I notice a dip in productivity, I relocate to a nearby caf√© for a focused 2-3 hour work session. This shift not only rejuvenates my creative juices but also acts as a mental 'reset,' helping me tackle tasks with renewed vigor.

**Meditate, even if it is 10 mins.**

If we can't chill alone for 10 mins without checking our phones, we've got a big problem. Meditation is like the mental gym. You're training your brain to slow down, focus, and just *be.* I swear, it's like rebooting your brain.

If you start by your own you‚Äôll be overwhelmed; look on Youtube for ‚Äúguided meditation‚Äù (you can find 5, 10, 15 and more videos depending on how you want to start). Also **Headpace** or **calm** have beginner guides usually for free.

**Say Thanks, Feel Better**

I've started jotting down five things I'm grateful for every day. Sounds simple, but does it change the game. When you focus on what you're thankful for, it's like you're hardwiring your brain to be happier. I'm talking better mood, stronger friendships, and even better health.

**Write it Out**

Very similar to the previous one, I've found that jotting down my thoughts every day is crazy beneficial. It's like I'm decluttering my brain. Plus, my communication skills have gone up a notch. You're going to need that, especially if you're aiming for success in today's world. There are also tons of apps for making journaling more enjoyable, like **Dayone, Diarium, Penzu**... Many of them are free.

**Get a Wise Council**

The most successful people have mentors or a coach. Imagine getting life advice from someone who's already walked the path you're on. It's like life-hacking with cheat codes. The impact of this can't be overstated. So, seek out someone who's a few steps ahead of you in the game and absorb their wisdom like a sponge. Now with AI there are also some AI coaches that are a great way to start, because coaching is all about asking yourself the right question. **Wave coaching** is a good one.

**Self-Care Isn't Selfish**

We're so busy grinding away for someone else that we forget to invest in the most important project: ourselves. Take 30 minutes daily to read, work out, or learn something new. Think of it as a non-negotiable meeting with yourself.

**Read, really read**

You'd be surprised how few people actually read regularly. Set aside some time to dive into a book‚Äîany book‚Äîthat piques your interest. It's like compound interest for your brain.

**Cold shower in the morning**

This might sound nuts, but taking a 3-minute cold shower gives you this weird boost for the whole day. It‚Äôs like you're shocking your body into beast mode. Seriously, try it.

Where are the climate activist when it comes to remote work??,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôve been thinking about how much remote work can impact climate change, and it feels like it should be a bigger part of the conversation among climate activists.

As we all know Remote work can significantly reduce daily commutes, which means fewer cars on the road and less emissions. Studies have shown that working from home can lower carbon footprints by reducing energy use in office buildings and transportation. Yet, I rarely see this pushed as a major climate strategy??

Considering how much attention is placed on cutting emissions in other areas (like transportation and energy production), it‚Äôs surprising that remote work isn‚Äôt being highlighted more. In my opinon climate activist should be on the front line championing remote work and fighting against large corporations and their unnecessary RTO mandates which contribute to the destruction of our planet.

Thoughts? Why aren‚Äôt we seeing more organized efforts promoting remote work as part of climate action? This is definitly a cause I see a lot of people supporting. Would love to hear your opinions!

I feel so much better working remote... Life is wonderful,"I've spent my whole working life feeling a square peg in a round hole. I'm far from reclusive but leaving my house every morning for 8-10 hours left me burned out every single time. I have mental health and other issues that make it truly challenging. 


I'm only 2 days/week in office at my new job and it's great. Usually the days I have to go in are fun and exciting with a variety of non desk based tasks and interactions with some really great colleagues. My WFH days I get to take it easy doing my administrative work. It's a good balance that evens out my more agoraphobic tendencies. 


I've been at my job for about 5 months and I am still incredibly thankful I found this job, for a lot of reasons, but remote work has simply enabled me to live a better, more functional life. I have never gone this long without calling in sick because I simply couldn't bring myself to go in that day. It was always my biggest weakness as an employee and now I am doing just fine. 


The only downside is, I don't think I can ever go back! I can only ever see myself seeking opportunities that allow me to WFH at least 60% of the time.

I feel like I do way more work as a remote worker than I did when I worked in the office.,"What I initially loved about remote work was the option to do household chores throughout the day. After I finished a task, I could do my laundry, I could walk the dog, I could do some cleaning, I could take a shower, you get it. In the office, I worked about the same amount of hours, but in my downtime, I was forced to sit and look busy or shoot the breeze with coworkers instead of actually being productive.

I moved from hybrid to work from home about a month ago. If I am away from my computer for more than two minutes, I am logged off. My boss is tracking how often my computer is logged off and for how long. I have two different productivity trackers installed, that track the amount of time it takes for me to be assigned a task versus viewing the task versus finishing the task. It‚Äôs insane.

Being tracked to this level, actually makes me less productive! I work in short bursts, not in one steady stream. I need a little breaks to work on different types of tasks or talk to people in order to keep my energy up. I‚Äôm not a fucking robot. Again, in the office, I wouldn‚Äôt be penalized for that.

"Bought a house 1.5 hours away, job is now requiring 5 day a week RTO, no exceptions.","Title is the problem. 3 months ago we bought a house 25 minutes from my work and 1.5 hours from my husbands work (I work on site). My husband had been working remotely and his work is now requiring 5 days a week in office with no option for hybrid. 

I have no idea how this is going to work out. His job is pretty speciality and it isn't common to find remote positions, he was just super lucky to find this one. He has looked at getting another job closer to home, but the compensation in our new area isn't as high. He now has to eat the commute or take a 25% pay cut, which isn't great considering that we just bought a house. 

We are also paying for child care and I am a nurse working 13 hour shifts, so him having a remote job is a huge help given that there is zero child care that works with my schedule. Him being home for 2 hours at the beginning and end of each day make it possible for us to have child care. With him commuting, this will make it so that he is pretty much working 12 hour days too.

Single mom losing my mind trying to find remote work!!!,"I got laid off from my job as a document processor for our state health insurance company back in August. Most of my experience is in customer service and healthcare. Ever since the layoff I have applied daily to any job that will hire me. All that seems to be open in my area is sales (I am not a salesperson and as a single mom, I can't rely on commission), tax preparers (No experience), and jobs that wouldn't sustain my basic living expenses. I'm 6 weeks away from finishing my Associates in Business before moving along to my Bachelor's. However, everything I see for my degree field either requires a Bachelor's degree or requires experience, which I obviously do not have. I struggle to understand how I can get experience if all the jobs require it. As I stated previously, I'm a single mom to a young child with no support so she is also no longer in daycare since I can't afford it. I know its frowned upon to work from home with a kid, but at this point its my only option until I get some money flowing again to get her back into daycare. My savings is running low and I have maybe a good month left, so immediate hire recommendations are preferred. I appreciate any and all advice on this!",HairParticular9549,2024-12-17,47,remotework
Robinhood CEO explains his reversal on remote work,,plun9,2024-05-27,269,remotework
"Why Everyone Should Cheer for Remote Work, Even If You Punch In On-Site","Here‚Äôs the deal:

- Traffic‚Äôs a Nightmare, Right? More folks working from home means fewer cars jamming up the roads. Less traffic equals fewer accidents and a smoother ride for everyone.
- Hunting for Parking Sucks: With less people driving to work, finding a parking spot won‚Äôt feel like the Hunger Games.
- Delays Be Gone: buses on time more often thanks to less traffic 
- Breath of Fresh Air: With fewer cars on the road, we‚Äôre not just cutting down on noise pollution but also slashing the amount of noxious gases choking up our air. This means a significant bump in air quality, making those deep, city breaths a lot less toxic.
- Healthier, Happier Cities: Embracing remote work could mean not just cleaner air but also fewer sick days for all. With less crowding on public transport and in offices, we're giving contagious diseases fewer chances to spread. Remember COVID?
- Local Love, Global Work: By rooting for remote work, we're supporting an economy where spending isn't confined to city centers. It's a shift that promises to rejuvenate neighborhood businesses, as remote workers distribute their dollars closer to home, breathing new life into local markets.

Bottom Line:

If you can‚Äôt work from home, you should still be all for remote work. Less hassle getting to work, and quicker rides. Plus, driving without playing dodge-the-idiot? Priceless.

Remote work changed my life,"I've been working exclusively remotely for almost two years now, and it's been a revolution in my life.

I can't understand why employers would insist that their employees return to the office when they can work from home, except perhaps to occupy the office space they rent.

Who wants to :

\- Be stuck in traffic for hours

\- Dress up in office mode every morning

\- Cashing in on the commute

\- Miss out on magical moments with your loved ones

\- Running out of time to live your passions and enjoy life The world of work isn't what it used to be.

We've redefined what's ""normal"".

Companies need to wake up and embrace change.

Employees have their say, and they're making it loud and clear:

Remote Work and the Elimination of bias,"I don't think this gets talked about enough and companies certainly don't feel compelled to address it because it counters their view of that sitting on an open floor is better for everyone.

Being remote, for me, means a lot more respect. I'm not a very tall person so I get passed over for promotions, smaller raises all sorts of slights that simply don't happen over Teams calls. I've even been accused of having a ""Napolean Complex"".  What they really mean is ""why don't you act your height"". I recognize that it's discrimination, but height discrimination isn't popular to talk about because it's so common. Check any dating app and you'll see ""sorry. no guys under 6 feet""

This hasn't happened since remote work started. Nobody sees your height anymore over teams. It was such a refreshing change.

Height is my issue but I'm sure there's 1000's of others who share the same view for different forms of discrimination. I'm sure many women feel less harassed due to remote work for example.

Please, if your company is making people return to floor. Ask them what they are changing to make sure the biases and discrimination that were eliminated during the pandemic don't come back.

Struggling Psychologically with Remote Work,"So I've been working remotely for 5 years. My entire professional career has been remotely , I never had the in-person office politics thing. Before that I worked in service where there was terrible pay but hustle and bustle.

Now I make more than I ever have but I find everyday feels like I'm wasting away. My tasks are open ended , with deadlines I set. There never is any consequence to me doing something at 2pm or me doing something at 2 am. I go from screen to screen , laptop ,phone, tv and it's disheartening. 

I really struggle with the discipline needed for work and for personal growth. I've read atomic habits and tried to implement small wins but 1 win to a 16 hour day is still out of balance. I've tried to do co-working spaces but my job has a lot of meetings so I end up locked up in one of those phone booths which doesn't feel much better.

I live alone and I don't have kids but I do have 1 cat. I really have no reason to interact with the outside world except to get groceries or do laundry. Every day feels like one long day and even when I break it up with a walk, or a hang with a friend , a gym class , it's like I have to be a helicopter parent and schedule my every hour to make it work cause I fall off so fast and that in itself is exhausting.

These feelings really scare me cause it makes me feel like I might need a new job , something hybrid but that feels like it could be an overreaction. Sometimes I feel like i should be able to just start a new habit or hobby and build up a side hustle but then I get intimidated by the prospect of doing that well too. 

Has anyone dealt with this too? How did you cope? Did something help you break the cycle?

Thank you in advanced. ",accioresearch,2024-10-12,0,remotework
2 Years of Remote Work: What I‚Äôve Learned ,"It‚Äôs hard to believe I‚Äôve been working remotely for two years now! The journey has been full of highs and a few challenges. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned along the way:

Pros:

* The freedom and flexibility are unmatched. Setting my own schedule and working from anywhere has been a game-changer.
* No commute! More time for things I enjoy, like hobbies and spending time with loved ones.
* Better work-life balance (most days!).

Cons:

* It can feel a bit isolating at times without face-to-face interaction.
* Maintaining boundaries between work and personal life is tricky.
* You have to be extra disciplined to stay productive.

New CEO won't let me work remote even though coworkers have been remote for years and I'm salty.,"Sorry if this isn't allowed here but I'm not sure where to post. Pretty much the title, I work for a medium sized company and that has offices in multiple states. During the pandemic we went fully remote for two years and then we've been hybrid for the last 2. During the hybrid phase, a couple of my coworkers moved out of state and were allowed to stay remote permanently and we also hired a few fully remote people during this time as well.

Fast forward to this year. I have been considering moving out of state since I had a death in the family and wanted to be closer to them, and its the same state as the other remote workers so I thought it would be fine. But we got a new CEO and he decided that he's going to clamp down on remote work. The remote folks have not been fired but they are barred from raises or promotions as long as they are remote And hr will not answer any questions about remote work and have been dodging my requests to set up a meeting. We are still hybrid for the time being but who knows how long that will last. I'm just irritated that management has done a complete 180 on this even though our work is completely computer based and there Is no real benefit to being in office.

Remote work is rarely what you think it is,"I see so many say they‚Äôre looking for entry level remote work that :

* Has flexible hours - show up whenever, work however long you want with breaks whenever and however long you want

* Allows you to travel and work from anywhere in the world

* Can be done while taking care of a newborns or toddlers

* Is easy and pays very well

* Can be done at the same time as another job 

Unless you have a degree and experience, most remote work doesn‚Äôt include any of the above. 

I‚Äôm speaking from both sides of this coin. I was a supervisor with a semi-flexible schedule. I was primary and then sole caregiver for my son as he grew, but I wasn‚Äôt on phones when he was young / in the ‚Äúcould start screaming any second with no advance warning‚Äù stage. I could often start work earlier than scheduled, and then take off early, but not always - if I had a meeting scheduled at the end of my normal shift, I was stuck. If I was working on a proposal of some sort, I could do quite a bit in my head while folding laundry or doing the dishes.  The pay was good, but the stress on my mental and physical health was bigger, and that‚Äôs why I eventually quit. 

Currently in a specialist / customer service roll. Shifts are set and I can‚Äôt start early. Even breaks and lunch are scheduled at specific times. Clocking in late (5 minutes is late) leads to occurrence points which add up to termination. Leaving early accrues the same occurrence points. The metrics you have to meet can be very stressful. You can‚Äôt always get the days off that you want approved.

Forced back to Office just to get fired,"Just wanted to share a quick story.

I was working remotely from abroad, and the company suddenly asked all the remote employees to start showing back to the office within a week. 

Now the main issue was that I was the only one working from abroad and I was halfway across the globe. Logistically it was not feasible to just book a flight and come back within a week as flights were super expensive and I had made arrangements for accomodation. On top of that I had a vacation planned in three weeks so going back home and then flying back just didn't make sense.

After some emails back and forth and arguing about it I was told that I had to be in the office by next week or there would be consequences. I complied, went to the office. They set up an HR meeting with me and fired me telling me some BS about how I was pushing it by not following HR policies and started digging up issues from a year ago stating that we are misaligned.

So yeah, I was forced back to the office just to get fired. But hey at least I got 2 months worth of salary as compensation.

Remote work is not for everyone,"I'm fully remote, I run a fully remote business, and I will only be hiring fully remote going forward - further, I really think remote work will grow in the future

BUT

I really don't think Remote Work is for everyone 

And I'm not saying this in the obvious way - hair dresser cannot work remote, doctors, surgeons, property developers, etc 

There are physical limitations to some jobs that will probably never change until robots come in clutch! 

I'm specifically talking about jobs that can be remote - even in those jobs, most people should not be remote 

Hot take I know but

1. Sales people, especially early in their career, I think can MASSIVELY benefit from being in a room with superiors, where they can learn and absorb knowledge - I think there are a lot of sales folk missing out on this knowledge, experience and perspective 

This doesn't just have to be sales people, we do software development, and I can see a lot of the guys who have only ever been remote, they don't interview as well, they don't deal with criticism, feedback, building rapport etc - the office really had something to say and add for culture and experience

2. Focus - most people, just don't have the discipline, focus and determination for remote, quite a few colleagues in covid, dropped performance and never got it back - life took priority over work - I'm not saying this is a bad thing or good, I'm just saying, in a performance orientated operating model, this does not do the employee or employer any good 

3. Environment - we hire from South Africa a lot, and I've had to repeatedly deal with multiple hours, up to 8 hours per day, of ""load shedding"" where they have no electricity - or new parents with a small apartment, where they just don't have the space to work, freedom from distracting husbands, wives, kids

4. The wrong career - a lot of people work to live, and with remote, you have such liberty to suck at your job, that if its not something you enjoy, or like or are interested in, your performance drops so much - and if you're not willing to do a job you like, or start liking the job you do have - I think you risk dismissal, poor performance, and less employment or progressive career opportunities 

  
Anyway, its food for thought - you can look at the above and complain and disagree, or you can look at it as an opportunity - to find work you enjoy, take remote work more seriously, go into the office with zeal and enthusiasm, then later move to remote, start a company where you can be remote, find ways to improve focus etc 

Return to office can suck, but I think for a lot of people, they needed it, and can greatly benefit from it :)

RTO thoughts from HR ,"I work in HR and wanted to share some thoughts on remote work, RTO policies, and what the future might hold.

First off, I know HR often gets blamed for enforcing RTO, but trust me, we don‚Äôt want to go back to the office either. The push comes from senior leadership, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs our job to implement it. But we dislike it just as much as everyone else, if not more, because we see firsthand how problematic it can be.

During the pandemic, when everyone was working from home, leadership frequently reminded us that we‚Äôd return to the office once it was safe. However, as the job market shifted in favor of employees, many people started quitting, citing the desire to remain remote during exit interviews. This wasn‚Äôt a small number. Entire teams were dismantled, and filling roles took forever because candidates were clear that remote work was non-negotiable. To combat this attrition and attract talent faster, leadership had no choice but to adjust their stance and embrace remote work as a permanent option.

But by 2024, as the job market turned back in favor of employers, they flipped the script again and announced RTO.

I believe these companies are setting themselves up for a rude awakening when the job market shifts back toward employees. The mass exodus they experienced before, and their struggle to fill positions due to a lack of flexible work options, will leave them with no choice but to adjust their stance again.

In the long run, I don‚Äôt see RTO lasting. Employees have experienced the benefits of remote work, and once the job market shifts again, I expect smart companies will leverage remote work to attract top talent. Meanwhile, those that stick with rigid RTO policies may find themselves falling behind.",Any_Conference550,2025-01-16,1953,remotework

Company Threatening to Revoke Remote Work Privileges as Punishment for Leaving Early or Arriving Late,"Hey everyone, I work a hybrid job where I'm remote for three weeks a month and in the office for one week. There‚Äôs no difference in the duties performed between home and office. It's the exact same work.

Recently, though, my company announced that remote work privileges could be revoked for employees who arrive late or leave early on in-office days. Productivity has never been an issue, as early mornings/late afternoons are typically unsupervised times to knock out individual tasks. Here‚Äôs the kicker: we‚Äôve never been clocked. Even on in-office days, there‚Äôs no formal clock-in or clock-out process. But now, HR is allegedly monitoring our FIB key scans (the cards we use to access the building) to track when we enter and leave.

It came as a surprise to all of us this week. For example, my shift ends at 4 PM, and sometimes I‚Äôd get to my car a few minutes early so I could drive off right as the clock stricks 4. But now, I have to be extra careful to swipe their FIB keys exactly at 4 to avoid any potential ""ding"" from HR. What about if someone is in front of me and swipes but holds the door open for me? I can't take any chances, and now need to make sure I still swipe out, even if the door is open.  There's no company policy in writing stating every employee must swipe in and out individually when entering and exiting the building. This just came out of left field after we have had such a casual in-office atmosphere for the past five years I've been with the company.

But now, all of a sudden, middle managers are claiming HR is reviewing FIB key timestamps and calling people out individually for discrepancies. It‚Äôs created a weird atmosphere of paranoia and micromanagement.

Has anyone else experienced something like this

Does this undermine the flexibility remote work is supposed to offer?

It‚Äôs frustrating because this feels like a complete 180 from how things were handled before, and it‚Äôs making the one-week in-office way more stressful than it needs to be. Now all of a sudden, we are told, if caught arriving late or leaving early, it will be a first-time warning, and the second time, removal of remote privileges, and the person in violation must return to the office full-time. I never knew WFH was a ""privilege"" instead of part of the company's work rotation.",Spiritual-Umpire4499,2025-01-25,5,remotework
RTO is a f*cking joke,"I don't buy that 5 day RTO will improve collaboration or any performance metrics. In fact I expect productivity to get worse. Here's why:

*Increased commute*

This one is probably the most obvious, but with thr average commute times being around 30 mins, that's an extra hour of your day gone. It's hard to give your best when you're 1) tired from commuting 2) feeling worn down because you have less time in the day to attend to personal life

That's not even considering the extra fuel needed to commute more, putting more financial pressure on employees in an already difficult economy

*Familiarity breeds contempt*

I've worked fully remote, fully in office and hybrid. In my opinion, hybrid is the sweet spot where you continue to manage social relationships with your coworkers which is very useful for productivity. However, seeing/having lunch with your coworkers after a few days a week gets old and annoying. More time spent together also means more chances to get tired of the little annoying things they might do. Like a dripping faucet. Hybrid allowed a nice reset so I felt ready for interaction again

*More hassle*

Prompting everyone to return means more struggle to find parking, more traffic, more accidents (I've seen an unreal amount of them the past couple weeks). 

Meal prepping for the entire week lest you have to eat out and spend unnecessary money. I know this is what they want, but it's frustrating nonetheless


*Less privacy/deep thought*

In office is okay when trying to purely execute on a task from muscle memory but for those who require quiet for deep concentration, it's not the place, especially for an open floorplan office. 

Additionally, coworkers will sometimes interrupt when you're in a flow state which really hurts overall productivity

When I worked fully remotely, I ended up getting promoted off of working 5-6 hour days because I was so much more productive working at home alone. 

*Additional factors*

More likely to get sick. It's winter and everyone is sick. They advise to stay home when sick but I honestly think it'd a badge of honor/dedication in the US to show up even when sick...I don't get it

*Worse for the environment*

It's the in thing for companies to claim they're sustainable or going green these days, but unecessarily forcing people to commute in more often completely opposes that. 

*Meetings are a huge waste of time*

There is this culture of forced delinquency in meetings where you may or may not be needed, but you may sit in a 90 min meeting and only spent 5 mins talking. That time could be used for mindless tasks like packing the dishwasher or folding clothes while still listening and contributing when necessary 

All in all, 5 day RTO seems completely unnecessary for people who can do their jobs remotely and it's infuriating to be micromanaged like this as an adult. As long as my semi annual reviews are good, who cares how often I'm in the office?

What‚Äôs something surprising you‚Äôve gained from working remotely ?,What unexpected opportunities or benefits have you experienced?,ROBASAHMEDKHAN,2025-01-10,20,remotework
Why Remote Work is healthy - Read this . ,"Read this post; I wrote it to help gather data from various articles (2023-24). If you‚Äôre considering remote work or are already working from home, you might be curious about its benefits for your health and well-being. I've been working remotely for the past five years, even before COVID, when many people weren‚Äôt familiar with the term 'remote work.' Today, I thought I should share some practical reasons why remote work is healthy and why everyone should try it at least once in their life.

Reasons:

1. **Flexibility and Work-Life Balance** Remote work allows you to set your schedule, which can lead to a healthier work-life balance. A study from[ FlexJobs ](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/benefits-of-remote-work/)found that 73% of people say flexible work arrangements reduce stress. When you can choose when to work, it‚Äôs easier to fit in breaks, exercise, and even spend time with family!
2. **Reduced Commute Stress** Commuting can be a major source of stress and fatigue. Like We've all experienced how painful it can be to travel on crowded metros, wait for long hours for auto cabs, and constantly stress about reaching the office on time. According to a study by the [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/monitor/sep06/commutes), longer commutes are linked to higher stress levels. by working remotely, you can save that time (and energy) for things you love‚Äîlike hobbies or just relaxing! Seriously this is the one of the important point for me to work remotely.
3. **Better Mental Health** Remote work can lead to improved mental health. A survey by[ Owl Labs ](https://empmonitor.com/blog/status-of-remote-work-in-2023/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20study%20by,transportation%2C%20meals%2C%20and%20clothing)revealed that remote workers report higher job satisfaction (about 82%!) and lower levels of burnout. Being able to create your own workspace (my art wall, with plants and books) and environment can help you feel more comfortable and focused.
4. **Healthier Lifestyle Choices** When you work from home, it‚Äôs easier to prioritise your health. You can cook healthier meals, take regular breaks to stretch or walk, and even set up a workspace that suits your needs. You are not only bound to take 15 mins tea break or 45 mins lunch break.  According to the [Global Workplace Analytics](https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics), remote workers tend to exercise more regularly, leading to better physical health.
5. **Increased Productivity** Many remote workers find they‚Äôre more productive at home. A study from [Stanford](https://www.apollotechnical.com/working-from-home-productivity-statistics/#:~:text=A%20study%20by%20Standford%20of,fewer%20breaks%20and%20sick%20days) found that remote workers are 13% more productive than their in-office counterparts. With fewer distractions from coworkers and the ability to create your ideal work environment, you might find it easier to focus and get things done.
6. **Stronger Relationships** It may seem counterintuitive, but remote work can strengthen relationships. The same Owl Labs survey found that remote workers often feel more connected to their teams due to regular check-ins and virtual hangouts. Plus, you can spend more time with loved ones outside of work!

In conclusion, remote work isn‚Äôt just a trend; it‚Äôs a way to support your health and happiness and FREEDOM. If you‚Äôre thinking about making the switch, consider these benefits and how they align with your lifestyle. Remember,, finding what works best for you is key to a happy, healthy work life!

How long do we think remote work will be commonplace in tech?,"I work and live in California, I own my condo about a 2 hour drive away from the office in LA with traffic. I‚Äôm full time remote but sometimes I‚Äôll go in to show face.

My current predicament is that my wife and I want to buy a bigger house and start a family but obviously the closer we get to LA the houses get way more expensive. We‚Äôve thought about moving further away in California which would be much more affordable for us. 

Would I screw myself buying a home further away when I‚Äôm not sure if my career would allow me to work from home forever? Moving up in position makes this unclear for me.

Trump Tariffs and Remote Work?,"Hi All,

I'm trying to find an answer regarding US remote workers based outside the US working for US companies or working for companies based in amother country and the Trump tariffs. Are the tariffs another way to end remote work?

And, secondly, for remote/virtual self employed workers with US clients, does anyone know how the Trump tariffs are going to affect this option? I think this one might be more obvious but I guess I'm wondering if it's about targeting a Mexican or Canadian company or if it's just about being outside of US borders providing goods and services to US clients and customers?

I'm concerned that we won't be able to get remote jobs anymore and/or work abroad.

I hope this makes sense. Any advice or article links or other resources for me to read would be very helpful.

Mark my words: a WFH wave will come to the US. It'll be BIG.,"No matter what reasons the CEOs have for mandating RTO, remote work will win the war.

As office space leases come up for renewal, many will simply expire and those expiring tenants will move to WFH. Maybe companies that own their office space will also see a cost savings, sell the office(s), and transition to WFH.

Not only that, but the tide is turning in the employee's favor with the Fed starting to decrease interest rates.

All this means more remote jobs opening up, and as they do, the office mandate companies will go to full-time WFH or else find themselves running on a skeleton crew, or worse. Like, a tech company with an office mandate could find themselves with no tech workers.

It'll be one bigass wave.

Fast-forward to about three months ago, and I was told that it actually wasn't possible because of the tax burden for them, finding health care, etc, for just one person in one state.

#1. STOP using indeed. 
‚Ä¢Don‚Äôt ditch it completely, but put it on hold for right now. The goal is to get an immediate response‚Ä¶ sites like indeed will SLOW YOU DOWN! 

#2. Stop applying to W-4 jobs and major companies. 
‚Ä¢ There is nothing wrong with W-4 jobs but remember there are 1099 jobs instead. No corporate, No micro managing, No working extra hours for extra coins. Re adjust your options and stop finding W-4 jobs. 

#3. Look for 1099 companies instead! 
‚Ä¢ 1099 is being your own boss. DON‚ÄôT get discouraged or intimidated. It‚Äôs the same as W-4.. you are on a regular pay roll (pay is better), you can create your own hours and not dealing with corporate. 

#4. Ditch your resume (YEP I SAID IT) 
‚Ä¢ independent contractors remote jobs will NEVER ask you for a resume. Instead they ask for a clear background check and to be over 18. It‚Äôs a simple sign up process and it takes 24-48 hours of approval. 
‚Ä¢ They do require an assessment but it‚Äôs EASY! It‚Äôs an assessment about you & how you like to work. You don‚Äôt need to have someone take it for you. If my old 18 year old self can do it SO CAN YOU! 

#5. DO NOT sign up for anyone ‚Äúvirtual call center‚Äù
‚Ä¢ This is a deep topic itself but I‚Äôm going to keep it short and sweet‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs real but you won‚Äôt get far nor will you make as much money you would in a REGULAR 9-5. Stay away from them. It‚Äôs temporary success and ends in failure. 

If you have any questions let me know, I tried to keep it short and simple. I do have tons of 1099 remote jobs if anyone wants the resources, just from my own experience with working with them. I will NEVER talk poorly with 1099 work. It‚Äôs a game changer, I travel full time now. ",GrapefruitSevere2419,2024-12-19,0,remotework

Last night my cold started to get worse I started to actually ‚Äúfeel‚Äù sick and the next morning I felt TERRIBLE and decided to call out. Probably because the night before we had a pretty intense team building event that took a lot of energy and since I was already sick I may have over exerted myself leading to my cold getting worse.

Why so many European startups require remote work from their base country?,"I'm currently looking for a job and see a lot of companies that specify that they are open for remote work, but only within their base country. I think this was relatively common for U.S. companies even pre-pandemic (and definitely now, too), although a good proportion of U.S. companies, as long as they permit remote, don't care about the country of residence, and simply specify ""remote (US East timezones)"" or something like this.

Whereas in Europe, I noticed that phrases like ""remote within Germany"", ""remote within UK"", or even ""remote within A, B, C"", where A, B, and C are several \*specific\* European countries became very common. I didn't notice that at all a few years ago.

Regret the return to office - remote work actually saved me more money,"I left my remote job earlier this year because I was pretty burnt out. The money was decent and I had the potential to grow my salary, but at that point, the money was not worth my mental health (I was almost hospitalized from burnout). I got a new job that is 5 days in the office and took a $10K paycut (which I thought would end up not making a difference, but it really does smh). I bought a car and of course, with the car came expenses for gas every week and a half, required maintenance and the dreaded insurance. At my job, there is also heavy pressure to go to happy hour and drink heavily, as well as spend money to participate in activities for ""the office culture"".

I realized immediately I made a huge mistake taking this in-office job. I know that I can start bringing lunches from home, say no to happy hours and activities, etc, but along with taking a paycut, I am losing so much money.

I am debating finding a remote job again so that I can save money and hopefully get a higher salary. I also hate going into the office. Is this a good idea? I would still have the car and its expenses, but I could potentially sell it. I know I made a lot of dumb mistakes, but I want to fix my situation.

The pandemic hurt the prospects of remote work long term ,"I see a lot of people here wishing for another pandemic, which is gross but not the point I want to make today. 

While the pandemic increased tremendously the amount of people working remotely, it did so in a way that lead to backlash. Plenty of people were forced into remote situations but not supported properly in how to best work remotely. Many people took advantage of it and in a public way that became newsworthy. The public tide turned against it because those that can't were bitter that suddenly so many were in a remote situation and they were not, even with the dangers of the pandemic.

The Real Cost of Remote Work: I analyzed 500 remote workers and these numbers are wild [OC] [Data Analysis],"Just finished a deep dive into remote work costs, and I thought you all might find this interesting. We hear a lot about how remote work saves money, but there's definitely another side to this story...

**The Numbers (Brace Yourselves):**

‚Ç¨3.23 MILLION annually on remote work infrastructure and issues. Here's the breakdown:

* ‚Ç¨1.16M - Just on admin labor (basically people managing other people's tech)
* ‚Ç¨895K - Compliance fines (yep, it hurts)
* ‚Ç¨873K - Turnover costs (turns out remote isn't for everyone)
* ‚Ç¨76.5K - Productivity losses from tech issues
* ‚Ç¨74.9K - Extra costs from not being able to bulk buy equipment
* ‚Ç¨64K - Security breach costs (scary stuff)
* ‚Ç¨44K - Lost/damaged equipment (people are... people)
* ‚Ç¨18K - IT support tickets

**The Reality Check:**

* Cost per remote employee: ‚Ç¨6,460
* This eats up 10.62% of our total operating expenses

**TL;DR:** Remote work is costing us ‚Ç¨6.5K per employee annually in hidden costs. That's like buying each employee a decent gaming PC every year and throwing it into a volcano.

What happens if I just refuse a RTO and continue working remote?,"Hey y'all, I saw there was one post on this more than 2 years ago, but figure there is more people likely having to go through this situation with the RTO push in the last year or two. 

Anyways, I've been at my job for 5.5 years now, and have been fully remote since March 2020. In mid-2021, they tried to get everyone to come back, and almost everyone basically told them to go fuck themselves. As a result, they sold the office in our city, and now they don't make any US employee go in outside of those they hire for the NY office. 

That said, I have noticed that all the roles they hire for nowadays are either hybrid or in-office roles, and while I don't worry this will affect me very soon (given I am more than 15 hours from the nearest current office), I am worried that they will stop hiring remote workers entirely and look to prioritize a RTO down the line, given I do live about 90 minutes away still from where the original office used to be. I know that our CEO does not like remote work, even if there are many higher ups that do, and so I worry eventually he'll win out. 

Honestly, the ability to work remote (and be able to travel/work outside the US on occasion) is the primary reason I am still at this job, as the pay is at least 10-20% less than I could get otherwise, the work has gotten to be less interesting, and my progression has stagnated as the company has gotten bigger. Given that, if they ever were to do a RTO, I am 99% sure I would look for other work.

However, I am curious hypothetically: for those who've had RTOs and just flat out refused, what did happen to you? For me I'd look at it as likely a win-win: either they let me continue doing it while I find a place that actually prioritizes it, or they fire me and maybe I get unemployment/severance pay while I look for that other job. 

However, I assume it is likely not that simple, so I'm curious how it is from other people with experience!",thethirdgreenman,2024-05-16,56,remotework

Why more companies do not switch to remote working?,"Hi! 

I have been working remotely for the last couple of months, and gotta admit it has been legendary.. I mean admittedly it gets intense every now and then, but overall it has been quite beneficial for my day-to-day planning as I feel like I have more control over my day. I believe I am more productive than I used to be as I feel simply more content with my living conditions (not having to travel to work etc. etc.) 

My question is, why more companies do not switch remote (or at least hybrid) working? I just don't understand; they wouldn't need to maintain a physical location to cater for all the people, would increase the output their workers are producing, and would be able to track who is doing what in a more efficient way. As a cherry on top, wouldn't the pool of available hires expand exponentially?

Got hired for a remote work without any video interview?,"Hello everyone!

I got hired to this company when they contacted me via e-mail about my application in LinkedIn 2 days ago. They said it was for a video editing position. They said training will happen via Zoom. I didn't apply for it (or maybe I did because I noticed some companies from the job posting are like parent companies who are filling out said positions for their smaller companies).

Yesterday, they sent me an "" intuitive series of screening questions"" via PDF in which I happily answered and it has 18 questions. The PDF; however, after the initial set of questions, displayed a job duty that seems to be related to programming instead of the ones from a video editing position. I didn't bother with it though since people make mistakes. 

They asked what rate I'm looking for, I said $30/hr.

Today, I got hired and now went heartbroken because this feels like a scam. After applying and doing interviews to a hundred of video editing jobs for the past few months already, getting this one was just too easy. No video interviews or call interviews, just this email and a set of questions.

In the new PDF, they explained that I can start on the 20th. It includes the video editing duties, benefits, compensation, the termination of employment, vacation, and the confidential stuff. 

They also offered $60/hr and $30/hr during the training session on Zoom.

They want me to write my full name, my residential address, signature, and date. On the email where this PDF came from, they said: 

""It is imperative that you print this letter, carefully peruse its contents, affix your signature with a copy of your valid front and back identification, which you must attach to this document for job confirmation, and then reply to this email with your response.""  
  
They also mentioned about sending office equipment which I got curious about because I will be using my computer for video editing anyways.

There are two names in the email: the sender's name and the CEO. I found their LinkedIn and indeed they work on said company. The company even looked legit on LinkedIn too.

Their new PDF isn't AI written.

Also on the last email, they said that ""any unclaimed portions of this offer will be forfeited as of the end of business on¬†December¬†13, 2024..."" so I really want to go through this application now.
