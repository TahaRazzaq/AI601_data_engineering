prompt = f"""
      You clean and validate data.

      Here is a record:

      {record.to_dict()}

      Do these 4 things:
      1 - Fill missing values (e.g. guess city from address if missing)
      2 - Standardize text (fix spelling, capitalization, categories)
      3 - Format data (e.g. 'Street, Borough, NY' format for addresses, ISO 8601 for dates)
      4 - Add a new column 'category' with value 'Noise' or 'Non-Noise' based on complaint

      IMPORTANT RULE:
      Return valid JSON only. Do not return anything except JSON.

      Good:
      {{
          ...
      }}

      Bad:
      Here is your cleaned data:
      {{
          ...
      }}
      Note: This data was cleaned...

      Check your output. If it's not only JSON, you have failed.
      """

prompt = f"""
    This is a cleaned NYC 311 record:

    {record}

    Write Python tests to check its validation.

    Only use `cleaned_df`, and not 'df' as the dataframe. Do not create a new dataframe.

    Check for the followings:
    - Missing values
    - Address format
    - ISO 8601 datetime
    - Complaint category is 'Noise' or 'Non-Noise'

    Write nothing but code.
